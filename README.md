This is a project developed in Scalalang by herrqian and Vidatschi for the lecture Software Engineering in Constance at the HTWG.

## Description:
Two players play against each other on a 6x7, 10x11 or 16x17 board. Each player has a different colour and aims to make a straight line of four pieces, which can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.
